This one is going to be fun, I personally loved the concept of `Fast Feedback`.

It is my intent to turn Fast Feedback into a new TodoMVC as i feel it represents a large surface area of interesting engineering topics.  
A fantastic oppurtunity to show off all the latest Next goodies...

Come back in a week, I was making a video to help some individuals,
half way through I couldn't stand my voice and now I am writing a small novel heh.

Also, I became sidetracked as I have some aviation videos i want to make first.  I'd be curious if a hybrid learn X language whilst learning how to fly would be fun?

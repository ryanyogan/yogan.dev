I decided I am going to become a YouTube influencer with
the hopes my crazy ideas bleed into your stack ðŸ¤£

I am kidding; however, I am going to start down the path of education. With a 
generous twist.  I'll make supporting videoes, a majority, will be written materials.  
I am going this way because im selfish and I love music, no tunes with YouTube, one
must jam out when learning!!

```ts
function hello(name: string) {
  return `${name.trim() || "Christopher Walken"} says, Hello World`;
}
```

A hiatus can be fun, then we become inspired to bring our personal sites back to life, teach,
learn, ignore it and start over in a few years. It's time to start over...

What inspired me? I love learning, I have an addiction, I will buy courses on
anything I know, it's my hobby, my fun. I like to see different styles, down to
how people indent their code, solve the same problem (do you like recursion, or do you like saving memory), etc..

I purchased a course, and immediatly knew the author had no desire to finish it, quite the opposite.
Flash a bunch of keywords, put up some Tailwind styles and a basic Next.js site, and then... he took 8k
from students and left!

Furthermore the information on Next.js I am seeing in simply incorrect, outdated, or sadly,
up-to-date and embracing anti-patterns. I intend to educate in a fun way, the proper way, and
you will not run into hydration issues. Why? Because we will force progressive enhancments to the
leaf nodes (this will make sense).

We are going to build something truly `production` grade, you could use what you learn and bring it to work,
knowing your co-workers will approve that PR, not say "Hey uh... this might work for 200 records, we have 28.5M..."

A lot of this is filler text as I am testing the MDX styling overrides, why did I not use AI? Because I spend all day
building prompt nonsense now, I want you, the reader, to see imperfection, mistakes, humanity!

```ts
function hello(name: string) {
  return name.toUpperCase().slice(0, 2);
}
```

A lot of this is filler text as I am testing the MDX styling overrides, why did I not use AI? Because I spend all day
building prompts now.  Random anecedote, I loved CoPilot 1 - 2 years ago, now it is complete nonsense to me,
does anyone else feel this way?  It feels like intellisense in the 90's, yeah that will work,
but my teammates will drop-kick my lunch out the window for code like that lol.

```ts
function hello(name: string) {
  return name.toUpperCase().slice(0, 2);
}
```

        I enjoy building useful and useless projects, some are for the kids,
        some are for me or the household, and some are simply me cloning
        projects to see if I can. Why the f@*k would you waste your time doing
        that Ryan? Good question, this is how I learn, this is what is fun to
        me. I digress...

        Note: To save time in my life, some of these projects are using Node and
        the server-less paradigm from Vercel. Vercel has a cold boot time of
        around 3 seconds, so please be patient as I do not want to convert these
        all to the edge. Some services haul ass, they are either static, on the
        edge, or using Fly.io. I will write a post about this topic in time, I
        promise, I won&apos;t ðŸ¤£.

          I love this little service and use it like it's going out of style,
          I DO NOT use this service for non-simulated
          aviation, please... use Foreflight lol. If you are a big simmer like
          me as well, I love pulling this little tool out if I have my VR on,
          give it a quick look for ATIS and runways, and go back to enjoying
          that VFR! I do have a service I use that I am making pretty for
          flight planning. This service uses Remix, Sqlite (yup, distributed,
          LiteFS!), and well.. web standards. It just works, I forgot about
          it, a year later in my Fly dashboard it was chugging along, no
          updates needed, nothing, it just works. Having said that, Remix is
          very much an exploration model for me at best. I am waiting to see
          what Shopify and crew do with it ðŸš€

          Myself and the kids like to learn, they have to (so the school tells
            us), I want to. Pick any topic and this tool will query GPT 4 to
            create either an open ended test, or a multiple choice test. This is
            legit fun, uses alot of db vectoring, really fun prompt engineering
            and a good oppurtunity to make something useful.

          is cool, their tech is cool, thus they are cool. That is essentially
          the theory of relativity in my mind. This was a fantastic way to
          learn the newer app based router for Next 13, this uses MongoDB and
          serverless, so enjoy that cold boot time ðŸ¥³

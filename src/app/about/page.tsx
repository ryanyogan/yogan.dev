        Hey there, fellow humans! I&apos;m Ryan, the software engineering wizard
        with more than 15 years of experience under my coding belt. From
        JavaScript to Ruby, Python to GoLang, I&apos;ve dabbled in more
        programming languages than there are types of cheese at a fancy wine
        tasting.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        I have had the privilege of working in a myriad of environments, ranging
        from scrappy start-ups with just three people to large enterprise
        organizations. Throughout my journey, I&apos;ve tackled various
        projects. From developing real-time data services in Clojure to building
        your everyday CRUD apps using popular MVC frameworks, I&apos;ve even
        taken the plunge and fully embraced the world of Single Page
        Applications (SPA). Although, I must admit, I&apos;m not entirely sure
        why we ventured down that path. These days, I find immense satisfaction
        in crafting a basic GoLang site with a sprinkle of Vanilla JavaScript.
        The result? Lightning-fast loading times that&apos;ll make you do a
        double-take! Trust me, it&apos;s a game-changer. LOL!
      </p>

      <br />

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        But wait, there&apos;s more! I&apos;ve even delved into the mystical
        realm of obscure tooling. Clojure, Erlang, OCaml, Haskell, R, F#, and
        yes, even the infamous ColdFusion. It&apos;s like a magical circus of
        languages, and I&apos;m the ringmaster juggling them all with finesse.

        Now, here&apos;s the juicy part - I am a certified nerd extraordinaire.
        I&apos;m not just talking about your run-of-the-mill nerd; I&apos;m
        nerdier than a collection of pocket protectors at a Star Trek
        convention. My love for this crazy world of coding started when I got my
        hands on a 386 running Windows 3.1 for Workgroups. Ah, the memories!
        Thanks to AOL and my wild desire to kick off unsuspecting internet users
        after 20 minutes of dial-up attempts, I embarked on a journey of digital
        mischief creating `punters`, kicking my friends off the internet ðŸ¤£. Who
        knew that my mischievousness AOL days, trying to re-create Winamp in
        VisualBasic, and reading the back of C++ books would evolve into a
        full-blown career?

        Whoops, I read People-Ware, uh-oh! I have been in this industry as an

        It was not until a fantastic leader recommended this book, I finally

        This topic is huge, and not nearly as fun to write about compared to
        engineering and aviation. I suspect all of 2 people would come here to
        read about how I personally like to make system-design interviews fun...
        I digress, if I am wrong, I will write!

        But it&apos;s not just about the coding for me. No, no, no. I&apos;m
        also a master of engineering leadership. Picture me, the fearless
        captain, leading my team through the treacherous waters of software
        development. I&apos;ll guide us to victory, armed with my trusty
        keyboard and a caffeinated beverage of choice. And when it comes to
        attention to detail, I&apos;m your guy. I obsess over pixels and rems on
        my side project sites like a crazed artist, ensuring every element is
        perfectly placed. Picasso, eat your heart out!

        I may be a nerd, but I&apos;m a nerd on a never-ending quest for
        knowledge. There&apos;s no challenge, book, or tutorial on a new
        language or paradigm that I won&apos;t devour like a ravenous code
        monster. I&apos;m always up for learning something new, because hey,
        life&apos;s too short to stick to just one programming language, right?

        acorns, look no further. I&apos;m here, ready to bring my quirky sense
        of humor and unparalleled coding skills to the table. Let&apos;s create

        Hey there, fellow humans! I&apos;m Ryan, the software engineering wizard
        with more than 15 years of experience under my coding belt. From
        JavaScript to Ruby, Python to GoLang, I&apos;ve dabbled in more
        programming languages than there are types of cheese at a fancy wine
        tasting.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        I have had the privilege of working in a myriad of environments, ranging
        from scrappy start-ups with just three people to large enterprise
        organizations. Throughout my journey, I&apos;ve tackled various
        projects. From developing real-time data services in Clojure to building
        your everyday CRUD apps using popular MVC frameworks, I&apos;ve even
        taken the plunge and fully embraced the world of Single Page
        Applications (SPA). Although, I must admit, I&apos;m not entirely sure
        why we ventured down that path. These days, I find immense satisfaction
        in crafting a basic GoLang site with a sprinkle of Vanilla JavaScript.
        The result? Lightning-fast loading times that&apos;ll make you do a
        double-take! Trust me, it&apos;s a game-changer. LOL!
      </p>

      <br />

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        But wait, there&apos;s more! I&apos;ve even delved into the mystical
        realm of obscure tooling. Clojure, Erlang, OCaml, Haskell, R, F#, and
        yes, even the infamous ColdFusion. It&apos;s like a magical circus of
        languages, and I&apos;m the ringmaster juggling them all with finesse.

        Now, here&apos;s the juicy part - I am a certified nerd extraordinaire.
        I&apos;m not just talking about your run-of-the-mill nerd; I&apos;m
        nerdier than a collection of pocket protectors at a Star Trek
        convention. My love for this crazy world of coding started when I got my
        hands on a 386 running Windows 3.1 for Workgroups. Ah, the memories!
        Thanks to AOL and my wild desire to create `pretty` user interfaces in
        Visual Basic ðŸ¤£. I scoured different chatrooms looking for `modules`
        that spied on the WinSock32 api, creating small applications that
        tinkered with AOL. Who knew that my silly AOL days, trying to re-create
        Winamp in VisualBasic, and reading the back of C++ books would evolve
        into a full-blown career?

        Over the past year, I&apos;ve been knee-deep in TypeScript, Next.JS 13,
        Remix, Three.js, and even tinkering with SvelteKit and Astro.build (this
        very site is an Astro site, by the way). I&apos;ve been exploring the
        fascinating world of OpenAI and indulging in some `edgy` computing â€“
        which is just a fancy way of saying I&apos;ve been re-learning caching
        techniques. My love for UI development comes in waves, and after a few
        years, I often roll back to the backend. Right now, I&apos;m
        rediscovering the joys of CSS and finding that less-is-more when it
        comes to styling. Who would have thought?
      </p>

      <br />

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        As a true adventurer, you&apos;ll find me dabbling in SwiftUI, Kotlin,
        Flutter, and React Native. Do I have a favorite? Absolutely not. Each of
        them brings a unique set of solutions to the challenges they were
        designed for, in my humble opinion.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        When it comes to backend languages, GoLang and Elixir hold a special
        place in my heart. Although, lately, the Bun-based projects have been
        adding some spice to my TypeScript-infused world! I have a penchant for
        working with large datasets. There&apos;s something exhilarating about
        rewriting Airflow services into stream-based services using Erlang,
        Scala, or Go. I can&apos;t pinpoint exactly when or where this
        fascination began, but I suspect it was during my time at H.G. Insights
        (extremely large data pipelines) while devouring the book on Concurrent
        Data Processing in Elixir. It all just made too much sense!

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        And speaking of Elixir and Erlang, let me confess my love for
        distributed embedded projects. Perhaps my closet is brimming with toys
        from SparkFun. The idea of controlling hardware with software has always
        captivated me. Who knows, someday, I might even have the knowledge to
        build my own experimental helicopter and end up making headlines! Just
        imagine the chaos!

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        Let me tell you a little secret â€“ I have a passion for sharing
        knowledge. It all started as an addiction to learning. Some might say I
        was trapped in tutorial hell for over 15 years, but I beg to differ. I
        simply adore exploring new perspectives. Now, I want to distill my own
        best practices and share them through tutorials. Oh, and by the way,
        testing is definitely a thing! Trust me on this.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        Currently, I&apos;m working on building a learning platform. Yes, I know
        what you&apos;re thinking â€“ there are already 200 similar platforms out
        there. But here&apos;s the twist: mine is absolutely free. I firmly
        believe that knowledge should not come at a cost. And hey, I&apos;m
        still learning too, so it&apos;s a win-win-win situation!

        This topic is huge, and not nearly as fun to write about compared to
        engineering and aviation. I suspect all of 2 people would come here to

        I digress, if I am wrong, I will write!

        But it&apos;s not just about the coding for me. No, no, no. I&apos;m
        also a master of engineering leadership. Picture me, the fearless
        captain, leading my team through the treacherous waters of software
        development. I&apos;ll guide us to victory, armed with my trusty
        keyboard and a caffeinated beverage of choice. And when it comes to
        attention to detail, I&apos;m your guy. I obsess over pixels and rems on
        my side project sites like a crazed artist, ensuring every element is
        perfectly placed. Picasso, eat your heart out!

      <br />

      <p className="prose prose-neutral dark:prose-invert">
        I may be a nerd, but I&apos;m a nerd on a never-ending quest for
        knowledge. There&apos;s no challenge, book, or tutorial on a new
        language or paradigm that I won&apos;t devour like a ravenous code
        monster. I&apos;m always up for learning something new, because hey,
        life&apos;s too short to stick to just one programming language, right?

        So, if you&apos;re in need of a software engineer who&apos;s as nerdy as
        a Dungeons & Dragons marathon and as dedicated as a squirrel hoarding
        acorns, look no further. I&apos;m here, ready to bring my quirky sense
